It is a "Gamble/Parlor" Game  Seen in the Philippines mostly during "Fiesta" and Christmas Seasons on late 80's and 90's, as of now Some Towns and local Barangays in Provinces are still allowing this type of game (together with BINGO Games, "ROLETA", etc. ) only during Fiesta and NO MINORs are allowed to bet.

The mechanics is simple, You just need to choose a Color to bet among six (6) Colors, and you or the operator must pull  a String or manually pull-up a lever to release the Multi-colored wooden Blocks/Dices. The Color on  the top of the (3) "rolled" wooden blocks/Dices are the winning colors.
